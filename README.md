# Student Grade Calculator
  * The Student Grade Calculator is a simple yet effective Java Swing application that allows users to input marks for multiple subjects, calculates the total and 
    average, and assigns a grade based on the percentage. It’s designed to help students quickly evaluate their academic performance in a user-friendly interface.

    * The GUI (Graphical User Interface)-
       The application uses Java Swing to create a neat and interactive interface. It includes:
           JFrame: This is the main window where everything happens.
           A JPanel: This organizes and holds all the components like text fields, labels, and buttons.
           JLabels: These display important information like titles, instructions, and results (e.g., total marks, percentage, and grade).
           JTextFields: Here, users can enter their marks for each subject. Each subject has its own text field.
           A JButton: When clicked, this button triggers the calculation of the total, percentage, and grade.
   * The Logic-
     Input Handling:
       The user enters marks for subjects in the text fields.
       The app reads these values when the "Calculate" button is pressed.
       It checks if the inputs are valid numbers and within the range (usually 0–100).
    Calculations:
       The program sums up the marks from all subjects.
       It calculates the total marks and the average percentage.
       Based on the percentage, it assigns a grade using a simple grading system:
           A: 90% and above
           B: 85%–89%
           C: 80%–84%
           D: 70%–79%
           E: 60%–69%
           F: Below 60%
    Output:
       The total marks, percentage, and grade are displayed on the screen using labels.
       If there’s an error (like entering a non-numeric value), the app shows an error message and asks the user to correct it.
